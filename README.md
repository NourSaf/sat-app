# The Satellite Dream

### Project Background
This is a two weeks project was created for Data As Material course at Parsons School of Design at the New School, New York in MSDV program. 

### Concept
Humans search for meaning in every aspect of their lives. In every culture there is a way that people use to read dreams of interpret dreams. What about machines? What do they see? and how do they dream? When the machine dreams who can interpret this dreams? As the machine see’s our world and translate it into numbers only another machine is able to interpret this dreams and seeings. 

Dreams are created based on things we have experienced through the day before or things that happened long ago. Humans talks to another humans to try to find patterns in those dreams and interpret them. 
 
Satellite are orbiting earth around the clock around the day around the year. We are effected by them very moment. But we do not see them. They are far and fast. This machine do not sleep and they are watching us the whole time.  

This project tracks satellite day and night dream through looking at it’s current location and altitude as well as it’s sensor data and the earth area it covers to determine what it’s seeing. After getting what the satellite is “seeing” Gemini AI gets the all this information and sets itself in the role of a Dream Witch and interpret the numbers and return them in the form human language to see what the satellite is seeing. 

### In short
The app keeps track of the location of ALOS-2 satellite in realtime and creates based on it's data a dream based on the location.
The app also shows an image of what the satellite is captuering in real time.
